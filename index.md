# Process and tooling recommendations for future Data Releases drawn from the experience of Data Preview 1

```{abstract}
Data Preview 1 was the first release of Rubin acquired, processed and published data. While DP1 achieved its goals and was released on time and to great success, we identified a number concerns that should be resolved before bigger data releases. 

This document is a proposal for process and tooling improvements to cover the lifecycle from after the Pipelines processing through to Rubin Science Platform publication of the data release.
